============

Experimenting with performance evaluation and improvements to Brandon Pelfrey's [smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) fluid simulation tutorial:

* [Real-time Physics 101: Letâ€™s Talk Particles](https://web.archive.org/web/20090530024753/http://blog.brandonpelfrey.com/?p=58)
* [Real-time Physics 102: Springboard into Constraints](https://web.archive.org/web/20090531100829/http://blog.brandonpelfrey.com/?p=242)
* [Real-Time Physics 103: Fluid Simulation in Games](https://web.archive.org/web/20090722233436/http://blog.brandonpelfrey.com/?p=303)

##### Requirements

* CMake >= 3.7.2
* C++11 compiler
* OpenGL support
* OpenMP support

##### Controls

* Q/Escape: Exit
* Space: Add more particles
* Mouse button: Attract nearby particles
* +/-: Increase/decrease the number of simulation steps per frame

You can use the [`OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/OMP_005fNUM_005fTHREADS.html#OMP_005fNUM_005fTHREADS) to limit the number of threads used by OpenMP.

##### Building

The repo is self-contained, so you should be able to clone and build without anything more than CMake and a compiler:

    git clone https://github.com/genpfault/sph-tutorial.git
    cd sph-tutorial
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
    cmake --build .


##### Devlog by mskr

I wanted to develop my own particle-based real-time fluid simulation in order to try building new interactive experiences with formable, mixable materials and unified physics. I also try to turn this vague and broad goal somehow into a workable topic for my master thesis in media informatics. So I forked this repo to quickly get started.

I was positively surprised how easy it was to build and to see beautiful animations. Because I am only motivated by graphical results, I began plugging in my GL renderer with shaders (which works only in Windows). Next I wanted to see, if I can improve the surface reconstruction and rendering of the fluid. Popular methods seem to be Curvature Flow and Ellipsoid Point Splatting, of which I added the original papers to the repo.
